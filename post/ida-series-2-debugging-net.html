	<p>Some time ago, I was looking at a piece of malware written in .NET. It called <code class="highlighter-rouge">WriteProcessMemory</code> and I was interested in dumping its buffer
before it was written, but managed debuggers (such as <em>dnSpy</em>) don’t allow you to easily break on native APIs (or maybe I just don’t know how).
Besides, the sample was obfuscated and de4dot didn’t help, so a native debugger was the clear choice.</p>

<p>However, if you load a .NET binary in IDA (as a PE file<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, not as a .NET assembly), put a breakpoint on the entry point, and run it, it will never break:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sV2zXdj.png" alt="breakpoint" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QMX4IkV.png" alt="it never breaks" /></p>

<p>By the time you manually break, press <kbd>G</kbd>, then type <kbd>kernel32_WriteProcessMemory</kbd>, then put a breakpoint, then resume execution, the malware
has already had time to call it, and you missed your chance to dump that data.</p>

<p>Why does it not break, though?</p>

<p>Obviously, because the code is never executed: the stub is never called, because the real entry point of a .NET binary is <code class="highlighter-rouge">MSCOREE!ShellShim__CorExeMain</code> (WinDbg helps a lot here):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>0:000&gt; bp $exentry  ; &lt;- put a breakpoint on the actual entry point
0:000&gt; g            ; &lt;- run
Breakpoint 0 hit
...
MSCOREE!ShellShim__CorExeMain:
70fd7cef 8bff            mov     edi,edi
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We now know the real entry point, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">MSCOREE</code> is not in the (static) view of IDA, so we can’t put a breakpoint. So, how can we break on it? (aside from using a different debugger, that is)</p>

<h4 id="changing-the-first-break-event">Changing the first break event</h4>

<p>By default, you can only breakpoint on your binary’s entry point (which might be CRT initialization, a TLS callback, or a custom entry point), but still not the very first possible breakpoint,
at which the first thread gets set up and which transfers control to your binary. If you’re familiar with OllyDbg, you’ll recognize this as the <em>system breakpoint</em>. In order to set up
IDA so it breaks there, go to <kbd>Debugger</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Debugger options...</kbd> and mark the <kbd>Suspend on debugging start</kbd> checkbox:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c0ofbKB.png" alt="suspend on debugging start" /></p>

<p>Then, run the binary, and you’ll see this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YK6uIUT.png" alt="first instruction" /></p>

<p>At this point, there’s nothing aside from your binary, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ntdll.dll</code>. After executing the first instruction, some more modules will be loaded (<code class="highlighter-rouge">kernel32</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">kernelbase</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mscoree</code>), and
the RTL will prepare and run your binary. To get to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MSCOREE!ShellShim__CorExeMain</code> function, just step a bit until you find a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">kernel32_BaseThreadInitThunk</code>, and check the
value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">EDX</code> register: it points to your target.</p>

<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>

<p>This approach is not the best, mostly because other debuggers such as WinDbg are much more powerful and, in general, better
(for stuff specific to Windows), but anyway I thought I’d write this post, just for the sake of doing it with IDA.</p>
